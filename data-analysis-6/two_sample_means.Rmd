# Change in headache severity

This data set was collected from a randomized controlled trial with the goal of determining the effect of acupuncture therapy on headache severity in patients with chronic headaches. We would first like to know what the average difference in headache severity was from baseline to 1 year after baseline, regardless of treatment group. The difference in headache severity score is summarized in Table 1. The reported headache severity score changed by -6.49 on average by 1 year from the baseline visit, with a standard deviation of 11.84. The median change in headache severity was -6.25, which is higher than the mean. In addition, the minimum change in headache severity of -55.75 was much more extreme than the maximum of 29. These observations suggest that the distribution of change in headache severity is left-skewed. This is confirmed by the longer left tail of the histogram of change in headache severity score, shown in Figure 1.

**Figure 1.** Histogram of change in headache severity score from baseline to 1 year.


It seems likely based on the distribution seen in Figure 1 that there was a change in mean headache severity at 1 year compared to the baseline, but we can perform a test to evaluate this. The parameter we are interested in is the population mean change in headache severity score. The null hypothesis is that the population mean difference in headache severity is equal to zero, and the alternative hypothesis is that the population mean difference in headache severity is not equal to zero.

Since we have two measurements from the same observational units (patients at two different points in time), we know that the two samples are dependent. Therefore, a paired t test is most appropriate. We can assume that we have simple random samples since the data is from a randomized controlled trial, and the sample size of 301 is much larger than 30. Therefore, the conditions for running a paired t test are satisfied. We can now perform the test using a significance level of 0.05.

```{R}
alpha = 0.05
t.test(data$change, na.rm=TRUE, alternative='two.sided')
cat(sprintf('critical value = %f', qt(p=1-alpha/2, df=300)))
```
The t statistic indicates that the observed mean difference in headache severity is -9.5 standard errors from the null hypothesis value of 0.0. Given the significance level of 0.05, we would have a 5% chance of seeing a t statistic more extreme than the critical value of 1.97 if the null hypothesis were true. The absolute value of the t statistic is much greater than the critical value, and the p-value of 2.2e-16 means that we would have a vanishingly small probability of seeing a t statistic at least this extreme if the null hypothesis were true. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis. We can interpret this as very strong evidence that the population mean headache severity score changed from baseline to 1 year. The 95% confidence interval states that if we ran this experiment repeatedly, 95% of the time the true population mean difference in headache severity would be captured in the interval. Since the null hypothesis value of 0 is not contained in the confidence interval of (-7.83, -5.14), this is evidence that the headache severity score was different at 1 year compared to the baseline in the population.

# Effect of acupuncture therapy

Another question we are interested in is whether acupuncture therapy had an effect on the change in headache severity. The treatment group in this study underwent acupuncture therapy while the control group did not. We can separately analyze numerical summaries of the change in headache severity score for each group, which are shown in Table 2. The headache severity score decreased by 4.37 on average for the control group with a standard deviation of 10.4, and it decreased by 8.33 on average for the treatment group with a standard deviation of 12.71. The differences between the change in headache severity for the two groups can be visually compared using the side-by-side box plots in Figure 2.

```{R}
data %>%
    drop_na(change) %>%
    mutate(
        group=factor(group, labels=c('control', 'treatment'))
    ) %>%
    group_by(group) %>%
    summarise(
        n=n(),
        mean=mean(change),
        SD=sd(change),
        Q1=quantile(change, 0.25),
        Q2=quantile(change, 0.50),
        Q3=quantile(change, 0.75),
        IQR=quantile(change, 0.75) - quantile(change, 0.25),
        min=min(change),
        max=max(change),
        range=max(change) - min(change)
    ) %>%
    mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits=2) %>%
    kable() %>%
    kable_styling()
```
**Table 2.** Measures of center and spread for change in headache severity score, split by treatment group.

```{R fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
data %>%
    ggplot(aes(
        x=factor(group), y=change
    )) +
    geom_boxplot(na.rm=TRUE, width=0.5) +
    xlab(NULL) +
    ylab(expression(Delta*' severity score')) +
    scale_x_discrete(
        labels=c('control', 'treatment')
    ) +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(
        panel.grid.major.y=element_line(color='grey80'),
    )
```

**Figure 2.** Side-by-side box plots of change in headache severity score for the treatment and control group.

Given the locations of the box plots in Figure 2, it is possible that there was a difference between the change in headache severity score for the treatment group that received acupuncture therapy and the control group that did not. Since the measurements are from two independent samples, we could compare them using a two-sample t test. However, this test is performed differently depending on if the population variances are equal, so first we need to determine whether the samples are from populations with unequal variance before proceeding with the t test.

We can compare the variances of the two samples using an F test for homogeneity. The population parameter we will test is the ratio between the variances. The null hypothesis is that the variance ratio is equal to 1.0, indicating that they are equal. The alternative hypothesis is that the variance ratio is not equal to 1.0, because they are unequal. We have two independent random samples and we can assume that the populations are normally distributed, so the conditions are satisfied to run the F test for homogeneity. We will use a significance level of 0.05.

```{R}
alpha = 0.05
var.test(change ~ group, data=data, alternative='two.sided')
cat(sprintf('critical value = %f', qf(p=alpha/2, df1=139, df2=160)))
```
The F statistic of 0.67 indicates that the change in headache severity of the control group had 67% as much variance as the treatment group. At the chosen significance level of 0.05, we would have a 5% chance of seeing a variance ratio at least as extreme as the critical value of 0.72 if the null hypothesis were true. The F statistic is less than critical value, and the p-value implies that we would only have a 1.57% chance of obtaining a variance ratio this extreme if the null hypothesis were true. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis. We have evidence that the population variances in change in headache severity are not equal between the treatment and control groups. If we repeatedly took 95% confidence intervals using this method, 95% of them would contain the true ratio of population variances. The fact that the confidence interval of (0.49, 0.93) does not contain the null hypothesis ratio of 1.0 supports the conclusion that the variances are unequal.

Now we turn back to the question of whether there was a difference in change in headache severity between the two groups. The parameter we will test is the difference in population mean change in headache severity between the treatment and control group. The null hypothesis is that there was no difference between the groups in the change in headache severity score, while the alternative hypothesis is that there was a difference in the change in headache severity score between the treatment and control group. We will assume two simple random samples since the study is a randomized controlled trial, and the sample size of both the treatment and control group are greater than 30. However, we have demonstrated that the samples have *unequal* variance. Therefore we have satisfied the conditions for running a two-sample t test with unequal variance, which we will run at significance level 0.05.
```{R}
alpha = 0.05
data$group2 <- factor(data$group, levels=c(1,0), labels=c('treatment', 'control'))
t.test(data$change ~ data$group2, var.equal=FALSE, alternative='two.sided')
cat(sprintf('critical value = %f', qt(p=1-alpha/2, df=297.94)))
```
The t statistic of -2.97 means that the observed difference in sample means is almost 3 standard errors less than then null hypothesis value of 0. At a significance level of 0.05, the critical value indicates that we would have a 5% chance of seeing a test statistic with an absolute value of 1.97 or more if the null hypothesis were true. The test statistic value of -2.97 is beyond the critical value, and the p-value means that we would only have a 0.32% probability of getting a test statistic at least this extreme if the null hypothesis were true. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and have strong evidence that there was a difference in the change in headache severity score between the group that received acupuncture therapy and the group that did not. The 95% confidence interval means that in repeated samples, 95% of the constructed intervals would contain the true difference in population means between the groups. The confidence interval of (-6.58, -1.34) does not contain the null hypothesis value of 0.0, so it supports the conclusion that the change in headache severity score was different between the treatment and control groups.
